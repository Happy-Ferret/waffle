New Features
------------
- [all platforms] Support for creating forward-compatible OpenGL contexts.
  See the documentation for WAFFLE_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE in manpage
  waffle_config(3).

- [all platforms] Support for creating OpenGL and OpenGL ES debug contexts.
  See the documentation for WAFFLE_CONTEXT_DEBUG in manpage waffle_config(3).

- [cgl] Improved support on Mac OS for choosing the OpenGL context version.
  This will be needed for Piglit to transparently run OpenGL 3.1 tests on Mac
  OS.

  Previously, Waffle required the client to choose exactly either 3.2 or leave
  the context version at its default value, 1.0. Now, Waffle emulates the
  behavior of EGL: the client may request any context flavor, and Waffle will
  promote the requested flavor to the latest supported flavor
  backwards-compatible with the requested one).
